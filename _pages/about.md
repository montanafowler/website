Montana grew up in the Santa Cruz Mountains in California, USA.  She then attended Brown University in Providence, RI, USA.  There she double majored in computer science and visual art.  

At Brown, Montana fell in love with painting while studying under <a href="https://wendyedwardspainting.com">Wendy Edwards</a>, <a href="https://jerrymischak.com">Jerry Mischak</a>, and <a href="https://www.ayanaevans.com">Ayana Evans</a>.  Her first exhibition was at Casa de Porras in Granada, Spain when she studied abroad and took a course with Spanish artist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/telasanimadasdealhambra/">Alhambra Garc√≠a Caballero (@telasanimadasdealhambra)</a> in 2018.  She has also enjoyed learning from Santa Cruz artist, <a href="https://www.carrieclayden.com">Carrie Clayden</a>.

At the University of California, Santa Cruz, Montana received her masters degree in Computational Media from the Creative Coding Lab in September of 2021.  She then moved to Montreal to begin her next adventure!

Artistically, Montana is primarily interested in following her intuition.  Her recent work begins abstract and either turns into a figurative piece or remains abstract.  At the moment, she is investigating how trusting herself will come through in her work.  After deciding to change her entire life and move to Canada in 2021, she is feeling a freedom and confidence that she hopes to convey in her work.

Currently, Montana's <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/MontanaFowlerArt">Etsy Shop</a> is closed.  The best ways to stay up to date on her work are to <a href="https://montanafowler.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=a53b48a7dada1d1df2268f45c&id=e5121f1348">subscribe to her newsletter</a>, or follow her on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/montanafowler_cs_art/">Instagram (@montanafowler_cs_art)</a>.
