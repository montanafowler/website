#### artist statement

Through her style of unblended mark-making, Montana creates acrylic, mixed media paintings exploring a high contrast life. A member of both artist and software developer communities, Montana is curious about why we place limitations on ourselves to belong.  The more we embrace the unexpected, the more we realize the lines we draw for ourselves are blurred.

Montana builds her compositions through layers of contrasting marks: transparent and opaque, small and large, twisted and straight.  Limited color palettes gel the marks created by her tools: palette knives, brushes, crayons & pastels. In her layering process, she enjoys the boldness required to cover an old mark with a new one, often finding the boldest decisions have the best effect on the piece.  

While Montana has felt the positive effects of being bold in her life, she also understands how vulnerability also builds strength. This led her to strive to create pieces with where honest marks form a cohesive image.  When we find somewhere we belong, we can be vulnerable, loose and unfinished while also being bold, cohesive and strong.  In her visual investigation into the limitations we place on ourselves, Montana believes that we discover a real sense of belonging when we don’t listen to any rules at all.

#### bio
Montana grew up in the Santa Cruz Mountains in California, USA.  She then attended [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) in Providence, RI, USA.  There she double majored in computer science and visual art.  

At Brown, Montana fell in love with painting while studying under <a href="https://wendyedwardspainting.com">Wendy Edwards</a>, <a href="https://jerrymischak.com">Jerry Mischak</a>, and <a href="https://www.ayanaevans.com">Ayana Evans</a>.  Her first exhibition was at Casa de Porras in Granada, Spain when she studied abroad and took a course with Spanish artist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/telasanimadasdealhambra/">Alhambra García Caballero</a> in 2018.  She has also enjoyed learning from Santa Cruz artist, <a href="https://www.carrieclayden.com">Carrie Clayden</a>.

After graduating from Brown, Montana moved to California to get her masters degree in <a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz</a>.  With her background in visual art and computer science, she focused her research on digital art tools.  For her masters thesis she built a generative art tool called SlimeArt.  In SlimeArt, users create colorful, dynamic particle simulations with an agent-based model of slime mold.

While her graduate studies focused on digital art and teaching computer science, Montana continued to develop her acrylic painting practice.  One of her paintings was selected for [an open call at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History calling for local artists’ work responding to the pandemic](https://www.santacruzmah.org/blog/itut).  The show exhibited during the spring of 2021.  Additionally, in 2021 she completed her own 100 Day Project of working in her sketchbooks, exhibited in a group show of local artists at the [R. Blitzer Gallery](https://www.instagram.com/rblitzergallery/?hl=en), and developed a daily painting practice.  In 2021 she released three different painting collections: [the Tree Series]({{site.baseurl}}/painting-collections/2021-1-tree-series/), a series of paintings of trees in Wilder Ranch State Park; [the Everyday Series]({{site.baseurl}}/painting-collections/2021-2-tree-series/), a series of small abstract paintings about her daily painting practice; and [the Fresh Start Collection]({{site.baseurl}}/painting-collections/2021-4-dec-paintings/), a series of four paintings about her new life in Montreal.

In September of 2021 she moved to Montreal after receiving her masters degree.  In Montreal, Montana works in her studio at [Ateliers3333](https://www.ateliers3333.com). In 2022 she released [a collection of winter creations]({{site.baseurl}}/painting-collections/2022-1-jan-paintings/), [a pair spring paintings]({{site.baseurl}}/painting-collections/2022-5-spring-paintings/), her [Unprocessed series]({{site.baseurl}}/painting-collections/2022-6-unprocessed/) from her 2022 100 Day Project of works on paper, and her [Fresh Air series]({{site.baseurl}}/painting-collections/2022-7-fresh-air/) of turquoise summer paintings. 

Montana spends every morning creating acrylic paintings on canvas, experiments in her sketchbooks, or works on paper. During the day, she works on creative tools as a software developer.
