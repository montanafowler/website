Montana grew up in the Santa Cruz Mountains in California, USA.  She then attended Brown University in Providence, RI, USA.  There she double majored in computer science and visual art.  

At Brown, Montana fell in love with painting while studying under <a href="https://wendyedwardspainting.com">Wendy Edwards</a>, <a href="https://jerrymischak.com">Jerry Mischak</a>, and <a href="https://www.ayanaevans.com">Ayana Evans</a>.  Her first exhibition was at Casa de Porras in Granada, Spain when she studied abroad and took a course with Spanish artist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/telasanimadasdealhambra/">Alhambra García Caballero (@telasanimadasdealhambra)</a> in 2018.  She has also enjoyed learning from Santa Cruz artist, <a href="https://www.carrieclayden.com">Carrie Clayden</a>.

After graduating from Brown, Montana moved to California to get her masters degree in Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  With her background in visual art and computer science, she focused her research on digital art tools.  For her masters thesis she built a generative art tool called SlimeArt.  In SlimeArt, users create colorful, dynamic particle simulations with an agent-based model of slime mold.

While her graduate studies focused on digital art and teaching computer science, Montana continued to develop her acrylic painting practice.  One of her paintings was selected for [an open call at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History calling for local artists’ work responding to the pandemic](https://www.santacruzmah.org/blog/itut).  The show exhibited during the spring of 2021.  Additionally, in 2021 she completed her own 100 Day Project of working in her sketchbooks, exhibited in a group show of local artists at the [R. Blitzer Gallery](https://www.instagram.com/rblitzergallery/?hl=en), and developed a daily painting practice.  In 2021 she released three different painting collections: [the Tree Series]({{site.baseurl}}/painting-collections/2021-1-tree-series/), a series of paintings of trees in Wilder Ranch State Park; the Everyday Series, a series of small abstract paintings about her daily painting practice; and the Fresh Start Collection, a series of four paintings about her new life in Montreal.

In September of 2021 she received her masters degree and promptly moved to Montreal.  In Montreal, Montana works in her home studio creating acrylic paintings ranging from 20 x 20 inches to 24 x 30 inches.  During the last four years of being a painter, Montana has developed a style of unblended mark making.  Before 2021, her work was primarily representational, but her 100 Day Project led her to transition to being an abstract artist exploring how to convey a sense of adventous freedom in her work.
