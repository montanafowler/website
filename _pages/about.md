#### artist statement

Through my style of unblended mark-making, I create acrylic, mixed-media paintings depicting landscapes of belonging. Aa a member of both artist and software developer communities, I am curious about why we place limitations on ourselves to belong.  

In my pieces, I visually investigates a tension between loose, chaotic imperfection and a cohesive composition. In recent work, I've discovered how to achieve this with fewer layers, finding that leaving exposed canvas with the first fluid layers adds a stillness.  

After years of exclusively exploring abstraction (and being in the closet) in 2023, I began adding figures into my work to find out how a subject would interact with my landscapes of belonging.  I am exploring how to bring charcoal sketches from life drawing sessions into my colorful, chaotic landscapes with collage and linework. 

When we find somewhere we belong, we can be vulnerable, loose and unfinished while also being bold, cohesive and strong.  In my visual investigation into the limitations we place on ourselves, I believe  we discover a real sense of belonging when we don’t listen to any rules at all.

#### bio
Montana has been painting seriously for seven years.  She grew up in the Santa Cruz Mountains in California, USA.  She then attended [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu) in Providence, RI, USA.  There she double majored in computer science and visual art.  

At Brown, Montana fell in love with painting while studying under <a href="https://wendyedwardspainting.com">Wendy Edwards</a>, <a href="https://jerrymischak.com">Jerry Mischak</a>, and <a href="https://www.ayanaevans.com">Ayana Evans</a>.  Her first exhibition was at Casa de Porras in Granada, Spain when she studied abroad and took a course with Spanish artist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/telasanimadasdealhambra/">Alhambra García Caballero</a> in 2018.  She has also enjoyed learning from Santa Cruz artist, <a href="https://www.carrieclayden.com">Carrie Clayden</a>.

After graduating from Brown, Montana moved to California to get her masters degree in <a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Computational Media at the University of California, Santa Cruz</a>.  With her background in visual art and computer science, she focused her research on digital art tools.  For her masters thesis she built a generative art tool called SlimeArt.  In SlimeArt, users create colorful, dynamic particle simulations with an agent-based model of slime mold.

While her graduate studies focused on digital art and teaching computer science, Montana continued to develop her acrylic painting practice.  One of her paintings was selected for [an open call at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History calling for local artists’ work responding to the pandemic](https://www.santacruzmah.org/blog/itut).  The show exhibited during the spring of 2021.  Additionally, in 2021 she completed her own 100 Day Project of working in her sketchbooks, exhibited in a group show of local artists at the [R. Blitzer Gallery](https://www.instagram.com/rblitzergallery/?hl=en), and developed a daily painting practice.  

In September of 2021 she moved to Montreal after receiving her masters degree.  In Montreal, Montana works in her studio at [Ateliers3333](https://www.ateliers3333.com). As an early bird, she paints in the morning before work. During the day, she works on creative tools as a software developer.
