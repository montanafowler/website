My friends joined me for a night in my studio to celebrate all the work I created as a **Baby Gay**.  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yourtinycatering/">Christale Terris (@yourtinycatering)</a> baked a gorgeous passionfruit cake inspired by one unnamed piece in the show. Inspired by Christale's cake, my friends suggested the name Passionate Fruit, a play on queerness & also my dad's childhood nickname for me (Fruit).

My friend Nin took beautiful film photos of my friends with my art as a wonderful vernissage gift. Thank you, Nin!

After 7 months in the studio, I joined the artists of Ateliers3333 to participate in the city's Open Doors event to debut the building to the public.  I shared my space and talked about art with artists,  visitors, and public officials.

My first public art event since covid was incredibly heartwarming.  After only living in Montreal for 9 months, my friends who felt like my family in a city so far from home, all came to the show.  It meant so much to me.

**Eve & Burl** was selected for an open call exhibition at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History.  The exhibition featured local artists responding to the pandemic.  **Eve & Burl** was inspired from a photograph Montana's friend, Lu (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lu.adami.art/">@lu.adami.art</a>, <a href="https://luadami.com/home.html">luadami.com</a>), took of their sister, Eve (<a href="https://eveadami.cargo.site">eveadami.cargo.site</a>), and their cat, Burl, on top of a cabinet during the early months of the pandemic.

**Climbing Together** (2020)   
acrylic on canvas  
24x30" 

During the pandemic, the Santa Cruz Visual Arts Council put together a virtual network of local artists called the Santa Cruz Visual Artists Network.  In the spring of 2021, three galleries split the work of the artists for a show. Montana's two pieces, **Chance Encounter** and **Climbing Together**, were hung in the <a href="http://rblitzergallery.com">R. Blitzer Gallery</a> on the west side of Santa Cruz.  It was the first time Montana saw art in public during the pandemic; it felt powerful. 

While working from home, Montana noticed a green sprout slowly growing out of a pot in her yard.  She kept an eye on it, and after growing taller and taller, it produced five gorgeous sunflowers.  These unexpected flowers springing out of a difficult time inspired **Chance Encounter**.

If you look closely at **Climbing Together**, you may find two hidden figures climbing the  purpley pink rock. **Climbing Together** is about cherishing those friends that take you on adventures.

In December of 2019, Montana had her first show selling work at a booth at a craft faire in her childhood community center.  Having an art show in the Santa Cruz Mountains after having lived on the east coast for four years meant so much to Montana.  In retrospect, she is so grateful she was able to have this show before large gatherings would become things of the past.

#### Senior Capstone Show

For Montana's senior capstone show at Brown University, she dedicated a wall of small paintings to memories with her friends.  The painting of the CIT lobby (the small painting on the far right) was purchased by Brown University's computer science department. It now hangs in the third floor atrium of the CIT.  The yellow floral painting was later purchased by a family friend of hers in the Santa Cruz Mountains.

Montana's first show at Brown University held nine large paintings. Each painting had a hand painted label with its title.  The show had a mix of paintings that, while addressing quite different subjects, were all personal to Montana.  In 2017, Montana image transfered  all of the code she had ever written at that point in her life onto the canvas.  Meanwhile, the tree and seahorse paintings added a natural element to the exhibition.  The large Buffy painting would become the best selling print on her Etsy shop two years later.  The abstract piece, in retrospect, would now be considered a window into the direction of her future work.  Additionally, three of the paintings in the show were personal responses to the grief of losing one of her closest childhood friends in high school. Tessa Joy Davis was an adventurous goofball that brought so much life to everyone who was lucky enough to know her.

While studying abroad in Granada, Spain, Montana took a painting course at Casa de Porras with Spanish artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/telasanimadasdealhambra/">Alhambra García Caballero (@telasanimadasdealhambra)</a>.  She painted as much as she possibly could in Granada, painting on her host family's terrace and after hours in the painting classroom.  She made so many paintings, Casa de Porras offered her an exhibiton in their lobby.  She named the show **Juega** after all the fun she had creating a collection of loose, expressive work for the first time.

To open the exhibition at Casa de Porras, an opening reception was held on the terrace of Montana's host mom's house.  It was a beautiful event with a rainbow and stunning views.
