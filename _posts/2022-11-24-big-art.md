## Focusing on art makes everything feel smaller.

My art has always been a big part of my life, but lately I find myself scribbling phrases in my journal like: "All I can think about is paint." 

I've let my art grow, quite literally.  During the summer I had this feeling that the canvases on my easel felt too small.  I wanted them to expand, give me more room, and take up more space.  So after our move to another apartment, I finally got going building large 3x3', 4x3', 4x4' canvases.

Working larger has given me more room, and, with that space, my work has become all-consuming.  It's hard to explain how it feels, making these pieces that feel incredibly new, and, yet, also like I was meant to make them all along.  

Making art teaches you to listen to that voice that’s telling you to do what you want to do.  That’s all there is to do when making art… no one is telling you to mix shades of green next… or to try adding marks with pastels. In a world that is completely open-ended, you have to find your own voice.  You get better and better at listening to it.  You realize that nothing breaks because you neglect some dishes to do a bit more painting.  You don't lose a friend for missing a hangout.  Nothing collapses when you let yourself be the way you want to be.  In fact, everything somehow expands ?

I've been told by some, that I am a sensitive person.  As such, I can make small things I shouldn't worry about eat at me, but my art helps me put them in perspective.  There's nothing quite like the magic of having purpose.
