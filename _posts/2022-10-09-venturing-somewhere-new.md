The whole pandemic I've had an itch to go to life drawing.  I've only ever drawn live nude models in my college intro class, but I remember loving it. A person, unlike a photograph, moves, shifts, breathes...  there's nothing quite like the challenge of rendering 3d in 2d.

During the pandemic I transitioned into exclusively abstract painting.  I never meant to take on the identity of being an abstract artist.  I don't introduce myself that way because it didn't happen intentionally.

Without my usual sources of inspiration (random ideas on commutes, traveling, being with people), I learned to close the loop on my creative process.  I would inspire myself to make work by playing with paint. What happens when I use this tool? mix these colors? play with transparency? let this dry?  Paint provides an endless playground, and I learned to find never-ending fun.

but now what?

This summer I finally found an in-person life drawing class at the Montreal Art Center.  My pandemic itch has been realized... but what does this mean for my work? I've been painting abstractly for two and a half years... it has become my comfort zone.

Maybe that's exactly why it's time to venture out there.

Recently, whenever I've been making art and hear a quote from a song or podcast, I've been writing them down then and there on whatever I'm working on.  It embeds what I'm thinking about in my art and sketchbooks.  I ran into this quote by Louise Fletcher I had written in my sketchbook:

> *"The magic comes when you stop caring.  If you can stop caring if what you're making is good or not, you can make enough of it to get good." â€”<a href="https://www.louisefletcherart.com/">Louise Fletcher</a>*

I realized that **that** is exactly why I'm going somewhere new, why I'm building big canvases, why I'm going to life drawing.

I've been feeling stuck because I've been caring.  Caring what others think, what I think... If I make myself make art I don't yet know how to make, I will have to stop caring.  I won't be able to create my vision because I'm learning new skills and working new muscles.  I will have to make lots of work I don't like to discover what I will.

I'm pumped with adrenaline for this next phase.  Let's see what happens ;)
