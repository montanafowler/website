Wow. What an incredible day. It‚Äôs always a lot of work putting together an art show. It‚Äôs always a crunch to get everything prepared, but the connection you feel makes it all worth it. 

I spend a lot of time alone in my studio, working away at things, and I haven‚Äôt been able to have a large in person event since December 2019. For the past 2.5 years, art has been pretty solitary for me. Having my show on Sunday reminded me of how special this feels to connect with people over art in person. I don‚Äôt know many people in Montreal yet, but my friends (who are my family here) really came out. They made me feel loved & supported. It meant the world to me. 

So I have a huge list of thank yous‚Ä¶ 

Thank you to the friends who came out to support me! *(Shout out to Ceci for helping me pack up ‚ù§Ô∏è)*

Thank you to the other friends and family who were unable to make it but cheered on from afar!  *(And to those of you that snuck in some presale purchases before the event! You made lots of visitors jealous when I explained the red dot meant it was already sold üòÖ)*

Thank you to the new people I met! I had such lovely conversations with vendors and visitors about all things art. Nothing makes me happier ‚ù§Ô∏è

Between the presale & the market the [Unprocessed collection](/website/painting-collections/2022-6-unprocessed/) is almost sold out.  There are a few pieces left if you'd like to check them out here.  [My Fresh Air series](/website/painting-collections/2022-7-fresh-air/) is also back online after the show.

Now that I've gotten some closure with both these collections, I am ready for something new! I'm not sure what is around the corner... There are a couple more turquoise paintings in progress, and I have a lot of canvases to finish building.  I'm looking forward to sharing whatever comes next!
