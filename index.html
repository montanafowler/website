		<p> Montana is an acrylic painter based in Montreal, QC.  Her practice consists of work on canvas, in sketchbooks, and, more recently, on paper for her 2022 100 Day Project. In her style of unblended mark-making, she explores how to create a piece with a tension between loose marks and a cohesive composition. In 2022, she moved from her home studio to a shared studio space in <a href="https://www.ateliers3333.com">Ateliers3333</a>.</p>

		<p> At a young age, Montana always had some sort of project in the works.  In elementary school she was either making a movie, working on a newspaper she ran for her friends, writing her novel, or making visual art.  Her mom would always tell her she was only happy when she was making something. </p>

		<p> In 2017, Montana's interests in different art mediums (film, book-making, layout design+) coalesced in her love for painting. After her first painting course with <a href="https://wendyedwardspainting.com">prof. Wendy Edwards</a>, she committed to painting for the rest of her degree in visual art. She fell in love with the way painting felt... playing with liquid color on a surface, an endless puzzle of experimentation.  She loved playing with the degree of control using different tools, paint consistencies, and layering styles. </p>

		<p> Today, Montana's art practice includes a balance of working in sketchbooks for personal experimentation, works on paper for her 2022 100 Day Project, and works on canvas.  <a href="/website/shop">See her available pieces in the shop</a>, or <a href="/website/painting-collections-home">browse her recent collections</a>.
