### February 2021
I began this series in December 2020.  Each of these pieces in my tree series began as abstract paintings and slowly evolved into trees with mixed media techniques.  I used collage, acrylic ink, spray paint, and acrylic paint pens on top of many layers of acrylic paint.  The trees' sillouettes come from photos I took of trees in Wilder Ranch State Park in Santa Cruz, CA.
