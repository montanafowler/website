**Hideout** has a tree house color palette that invites you to climb right in. It's dark shapes surround a warmer center.  This composition gives the piece structure.  While big shapes give the piece a bold composition from far away, up close there are fun details to investigate: ink drips, thin layers, and pastel scribbles.

**Mystery Spot**'s hazy layers give it an atmospheric look.  It's spacious with its greys and greens having subtle color shifts between the birdlike darker shapes.
